Road Budgify - Damage Cost Estimation Disclosure

Welcome to Road Budgify! Before you proceed to use our app, we want to provide you with important information about the nature of our damage cost estimation feature. Please read the following disclosure carefully:


AI classification:

This application utilizes advanced algorithms to classify images as either asphalt or concrete. However, it is essential to note that certain random images or pictures that do not depict roads or surfaces may generate inaccurate results. 
Factors such as lighting conditions, image quality, and varying perspectives can affect the classification accuracy. The app's performance is optimized for identifying road surfaces, specifically asphalt and concrete. It might produce false positives when analyzing unrelated or dissimilar images. 
Users should be aware that the accuracy of classifications depends on the quality and relevance of the input images. By using this application, you acknowledge and accept the possibility of false positive results for images not representative of road surfaces.

The damage cost estimates provided by Road Budgify are intended for informational purposes only. They are based on algorithms and user-inputted data, and as such, they may not represent the actual costs of road repairs accurately.

User-Provided Data:

The accuracy of the damage cost estimates heavily relies on the accuracy of the data provided by users. Any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the input data may result in variations in the estimated costs.

Professional Evaluation Recommended:

Dynamic Nature of Costs:

Road repair costs can be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to regional variations in material prices, labor costs, and regulatory requirements. Road Budgify attempts to consider these factors, but users should be aware that these costs can change over time.
