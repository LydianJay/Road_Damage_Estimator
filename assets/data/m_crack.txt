Crack Sealing:

 * Use a router to widen and clean the crack(optional).
 
 * Use compressed air or high-pressure water to clean the crack.

 * Heat the crack for better adhesion (optional).

 * Fill the crack with hot-pour or cold-pour crack sealing material (Rubberized Asphalt can be used).

 * Smooth the sealed area for evenness.
